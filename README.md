## Hi there👋

I like to explore operating systems, Computer architecture, Netwroking, software design.     
or say i really like to explore the work under the hood.   

I don’t know everything yet (who does?), but I’ve been diving into **low-level programming**

I mainly use in C, C++, exploring Golang.
